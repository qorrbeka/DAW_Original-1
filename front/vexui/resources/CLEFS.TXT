Clefs Font - Windows Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:
^^^^^^^^
This font contains clefs with which you can choose to replace those found in the Petrucci font.  This font is intended for use with Finale 3.5 and later versions.  I have no idea how it works with earlier versions of the programme.  It is designed for use with Windows 3.1 and later.


To install this font into Windows 3.1, do the following:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 (1)  Open the Windows Control Panel by double-clicking on its icon.
	(2)  Open the Fonts panel by double-clicking on its icon.  The font panel will appear.
	(3)  Click on the Add Fonts button.  The Add Fonts panel will appear.
	(4)  Choose the appropriate disk drive from the Drives list.
	(5)  Choose the appropriate directory from the Directories list.
	(6)  Select Clefs.
	(7)  Click "OK" to install the font.

To use this font from within Finale, go to Select Default Fonts… from the Options menu.  Within Music Characters, select Clefs, then click on the Set Font… button, and select Clefs from the list which appears.  Finally use the Clef Designer dialog from within the Options menu to select the different clefs.
